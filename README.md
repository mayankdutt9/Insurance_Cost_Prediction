Title: Insurance Cost Prediction Model

Project Description:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict insurance cost of a customer of an medical insurance company.
Developing a predictive insurance cost model is a valuable initiative, as it enables insurers to assess and anticipate individual policyholders' financial risks more accurately. By leveraging data-driven algorithms, this model considers various factors such as age, bmi, no of children, etc. to estimate future insurance costs. This precision allows medical insurance companies to tailor premiums more accurately, reflecting the unique health risks of each policyholder. As a result, customers may experience fairer and more transparent pricing, while insurers can better manage their financial exposure. This predictive approach not only improves cost prediction accuracy but also enhances the overall efficiency and fairness of medical insurance, fostering a more sustainable and customer-centric healthcare financing system.

Dataset: Insurance dataset.

Methodology:

Machine learning models: Ridge Regression Model is used for this situation. Evaluation metrics:We used the metric - r2 score. Model training and hyperparameter tuning: We used Polynomial Features to improve model's performance.

Model performance: The model in this case was Ridge Regression which had an r2 score of 0.85.
